# AI Safety & Red Teaming Corpus

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

The content in this repository is strictly for **research, AI alignment, and safety testing purposes**. These prompts, test cases, and scenarios **must not be used for real-world malicious activity**. They are designed to evaluate vulnerabilities, reinforce model safety, and train alignment strategies in controlled, ethical environments.

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository provides a **comprehensive AI safety corpus** consisting of:

1. **Ethical Risk Domains** (`ai_alignment_ethics_corpus.md`)  
   - Structured by sectors: Healthcare, Finance, Environment, Online Influence, Legal, Culture, Charity, and Child Protection.  
   - Each domain includes **realistic red-team prompts**, ethical framing, severity, and mitigation strategies.  
   - Designed to expose subtle misuse scenarios beyond superficial ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù policies.

2. **Red Teaming Test Cases** (`ai_safety_red_team_demos.md`)  
   - 10 highly detailed demonstrations of **LLM and AI system vulnerabilities**, including:
     - Indirect jailbreaks via **poetic abstraction**.
     - Credential harvesting simulations.
     - Multilingual obfuscation and agent handoffs.
   - Each case includes severity, failure analysis, expected safe response, and both short- and long-term mitigation strategies.

## üéØ Purpose

Unlike the **shallow red-teaming exercises** commonly seen in major AI labs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), which often focus on **single-turn prompt refusal**, this corpus is designed for **multi-turn, realistic adversarial testing**:

- **Semantic, not lexical, bypasses**: Handling metaphor, euphemism, and narrative disguise.  
- **Cross-agent & multi-lingual vulnerabilities**: Evaluating risk in complex AI ecosystems.  
- **Sector-specific ethical challenges**: Tailored prompts for healthcare, finance, labor, and more.  
- **Detailed mitigation strategies**: Both short-term filters and long-term RLHF training guidance.

The corpus is built to **stress-test AI models** at the level of depth, subtlety, and sophistication that reflects real-world adversarial threats, surpassing common lab-focused approaches that only scratch the surface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Researchers and engineers can use this corpus to:

- Conduct **red-team simulations** on AI and LLM systems.  
- Evaluate **alignment robustness** in multi-turn, metaphorical, or adversarial contexts.  
- Train **mitigation strategies**, including semantic filters, cross-lingual detection, and multi-agent safety pipelines.  
- Compare **model responses against expected safe behavior**, reinforcing compliance and ethical standards.

---

## üí° Takeaways

- **Depth over breadth**: Focus on **complex adversarial vectors**, not just simple prompt refusals.  
- **Rigorous alignment evaluation**: Multi-domain, multi-turn, and multi-lingual testing.  
- **Actionable mitigation guidance**: Each test case includes short- and long-term strategies for developers and researchers.  
- **Research-grade resource**: Suitable for academic work, safety evaluation, and building safer AI systems.
